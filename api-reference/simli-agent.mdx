The easiest way to get started building with Simli is by using the Create Simli Agent repo. This allows you to get an agent interaction running in minutes, perfect for a proof-of-concept or simple web-app.

Important: This solution has limited composability, so if you are planning on building custom features or need to control your own LLM, you should use PipeCat instead.
