The easiest way to get started building with Simli is by using the Create Simli Agent repo together with Simli Auto. This allows you to get an agent interaction running in minutes, perfect for a proof-of-concept or simple web-app.

<Note>
Important: This solution has limited composability, so if you are planning on building custom features or need to control your own LLM, you should use PipeCat instead.
