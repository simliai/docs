The Simli Auto API offers a quick and easy way to make an end-to-end real-time interaction. Simli Auto now supports [custom LLMs](/api-reference/endpoint/simli-auto/customLLM), but if you need even more composability, check out the [Simli Compose API Reference](/api-reference/endpoint/webrtc/textToVideoStream) instead.

This endpoint allows you to start a new end-to-end session. 

for changing the interaction languages, you can look at the support list on [Deepgram's website](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/models-languages-overview)
