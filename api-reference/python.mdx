The Simli WebRTC SDK is a powerful tool for integrating real-time audio and video streaming capabilities into your python applications using WebRTC. You can use this SDK to display a Simli outside the browser, save the stream into a file, or integrate your stream in your program however you want!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A Simli account with an API key
2. Python3.9 or higher

### Installation

Install `simli-ai` package:

```bash
pip install simli-ai
```

## Usage

### Step 1: Creating the SimliClient

Create an instance of SimliClient and initialize it with your configuration:

```python
import asyncio
from simli import SimliClient, SimliConfig
from simli.renderers import FileRenderer
async def main():
    connection =  SimliClient(
        SimliConfig(
            apiKey="YOUR_SIMLI_API_KEY",  # API Key
            faceId="YOUR_FACE_ID",  # Face ID
            maxSessionLength=20,
            maxIdleTime=10,
        )
    )
    await connection.Initialize()

asyncio.run(main())
```

Make sure to replace `"YOUR_SIMLI_API_KEY"` with your actual Simli API key, and `"YOUR_FACE_ID"` with the desired face ID for your application.

### Step 2: Send Audio Data

Once the connection is established, you can start sending audio data:

```python
# Example: sending audio data (should be PCM16 format, 16KHz sample rate)
await connection.sendSilence(1) # to send 1 second of silence to the API
await connection.send(audio) # where audio is a bytes object representing the raw audio data
```

Ensure that your audio data is in PCM16 format with a 16KHz sample rate.

## simli-ai API reference

### simli.SimliConfig

This is a dataclass that represents the config sent to [https://api.simli.ai/startAudioVideoSession] to get a session_token

- `apiKey`: str. Your API key you get from [https://app.simli.com/profile]
- `faceId`: str # FaceID you can get from [https://docs.simli.com/api-reference/available-faces] or create your own on [https://app.simli.com]
- `syncAudio`: bool. Specify whether your want to receive the audio back (Leave true if unsure)
- `handleSilence`: bool. Specify whether you want to keep the Simli Avatar Moving when you don't send in Audio
- `maxSessionLength`: int. A hard time limit (in seconds) after which the session will disconnect
- `maxIdleTime`: int. A soft time limit (in seconds) that disconnects the session after a period of not sending in data

### simli.SimliClient

- `class SimlClient(config: SimliConfig, useTurnServer: bool = False, latencyInterval: int = 60)`
  - SimliClient constructor
    - config: refer to [SimliConfig](#simli-simliconfig)
    - useTurnServer: When set to True, it uses a Turn server to connect to Simli API, useful if behing a NATed firewall or using mobile data. Turn on if you're having connectivity issues
    - latencyInterval: delay (in seconds) between ping calls to calculate latency between your machine and simli server. Set to 0 to disable.
- `async def Initialize()`: Initializes the SimliClient with the provided configuration and starts the WebRTC Connection
- `async close()`: Closes the WebRTC connection and cleans up resources.
- `async send(data: bytes | string)`: Sends audio data or control signals to the server.
- `async sedSilence(duration: float= 0.1875)`: Sends the specified duration to the server as silent audio, used mostly in Idle mode.
- `async clearBuffer()`: Clears the audio buffer, best used when you want the avatar to stop talking.
- `async getNextVideoFrame()`: returns the following [PyAV](https://pyav.basswood-io.com/docs/stable/) VideoFrame.
- `async getNextAudioFrame()`: returns the following PyAV AudioFrame.
- `async getVideoStreamIterator(targetFormat:str)`: Creates an async iterator that retrieves all the video frames in order. Can be used in an `async for` loop.
  - `targetFormat`: specify what format you want the frames to be in, defaults to RGB.
- `async getAudioStreamIterator(targetSampleRate)`: Creates an async iterator that retrieves all the video frames in order. Can be used in an `async for` loop.
  - `targetSampleRate: int`: specify the sampling rate of the output audio, specify if you want to use the audio in something else that has specific sampling rate constraints

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure your API key is correct and active.
2. Verify that your face ID is valid and associated with your account.
3. Check that your audio data is in the correct format (PCM16, 16KHz).
4. Verify that you have the necessary permissions for accessing the user's media devices.
5. Review the console logs for any error messages or warnings.
