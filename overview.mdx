The Simli speech-to-video API lets developers create lip-synced AI avatar interactions. With visual AI avatars, you can create anything! Mock interviews, sales assistants, language learning, coaching, customer-service training, historical characters, and so much more. To see it in action first, [try our demo](https://www.simli.com/demo).
